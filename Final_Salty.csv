On a military deployment you can’t rely on a frequent change of scenery to hide your insanity.<p>The most common example of excuse that people would hide behind pre-pandemic is finances. Bad financial situations are stressful, but stress is not a mental health disorder. Extreme stresses though often exacerbate pre-existing illnesses. In that regard bad finances don’t produce mental health disorders as frequently as suggested but instead exaggerate pre-existing conditions that become more clearly identifiable.<p>The difference between stress and a mental health disorder is something called <i>homeostasis</i>, which is the ability of the brain to return to a state of regular emotional equilibrium following an incidence of high stress. The military refers to the cognitive process of actively maintaining homeostasis as <i>resiliency</i> and it’s part of our annual training. The inability to return to resume functions of prior behavior following a major stressor is likely the result of a mental health illness.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.academia.edu&#x2F;4970988&#x2F;Mental_Health_DSM-V_mental_disorder_and_homeostasis_dream_sleep_and_day_time_interaction_of_cerebellum_and_cerebrum_in_the_regulation_of_behaviour_emotion_and_cognition"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.academia.edu&#x2F;4970988&#x2F;Mental_Health_DSM-V_mental_...</a>",austincheney,23319576,False,0.148

23320537,"Given the stress of the current crisis, this does not surprise me. The topic of the news for the past two months now is that there&#x27;s a doom plague, a mask might not save you, people are violating quarantine to spread the plague, the economy is going to collapse, and Trump is making it all worse. People have lost their jobs, are being told they can&#x27;t work, that they must stay home, they must stay away from other people, they must be afraid, etc and so forth. So in light of that, it does not surprise me at all that depression and anxiety are ramping up in the adult population.<p>Neither does the breakdown by age surprise me, with it being worst amongst 18-29 year-olds, and declining with age. I would love to see a finer breakdown in that category. Here is my hypothesis:<p>For the youngest of adults, especially those just now entering adulthood or their professional careers, this is probably the first societal shock they&#x27;ve experienced. They did what they were supposed to according to The Plan of How The World Works. They persevered through the soul-crushing hell that is high school, and got the best grades they could, and applied for colleges, and are ready to become adults. Or maybe they didn&#x27;t get quite so good grades or dropped out and were banking on being able to support themselves with some kind of basic labor or service job. Or maybe they&#x27;ve taken out all the student loans to go to college, and are coming into what&#x27;s supposed to be the beginning of their professional career to an economy that&#x27;s about to collapse. Or if they haven&#x27;t graduated, now there&#x27;s the uncertainty if whether or nor they&#x27;ll be able to finish their degree, with there being question about when&#x2F;if campuses will open back up, or whether the online classes offered as substitutes will actually do any useful teaching. Regardless of the myriad variations available in the above, the basic situation remains the same: here they are, their life finally about to begin, and now the economy is collapsing, everyone&#x27;s dying, a fascist oompa loompa controls the government, and generally the world is over.  Well, shit. Now what?<p>I speak somewhat hyperbolically in describing the above, of course, but I stand by my basic point: The youngest adults are beginning their adulthood in fairly bad situation. And unless they&#x27;re old enough to remember the previous societal shocks that were supposed end the world, but didn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s all to easy to come near the despair event horizon or even cross it.<p>Compare those who are a little older, or hell, a lot older. They&#x27;ve seen the Housing Crisis, War, 9&#x2F;11, the dot-com bubble, and so on and so forth. And yet, they didn&#x27;t die and are still here. Odds are, at least one of the previous crises made their life worse for a time, or messed up what was supposed to be a bright future or golden opportunity. And yet, they didn&#x27;t die, and are still here. And the older they are, odds are, the more times they&#x27;ve seen that the world was about to end, and then didn&#x27;t. And the more likely they&#x27;ve internalized the lesson that in crises like these, how well they come out of it depends largely on their attitude and how they apply themselves to getting through it. And so we see that with the older and older age groups, the anxiety and depression numbers are lower and lower.<p>This post might sound a bit ranty, and like I am projecting, and I&#x27;d be lying if I tried to claim there weren&#x27;t threads of that woven through it. But it is not my intention for this to be just a &quot;toughen up you whippersnappers and get off my lawn!&quot; type post. No, if I had to have a message for the youngest of adults, it&#x27;s this: I get it. The world just got turned upside down an nobody knows what&#x27;s coming next.

IANAL but I made it a point to understand this over the years.  The basics go something like this:  Freedom of speech does not mean you are free of the consequences of your speech.  The first amendment to the US constitution is intended to limit the ability of government to restrict speech, not private enterprise.  The instant you enter a grocery store you can&#x27;t stand there and say whatever you want.  Outside, in a public space, yes, go for it.  Inside, no, you can&#x27;t.  And you are subject to whatever rules the company might have in place.  Same with your employer.<p>And yet we have the effect of social media companies, where very public speech is transacted every microsecond of the day, networks are created, fed, encouraged and monetized by algorithms and passionate communications are pure gold.  Passion, hatred, outrage, despair, fear; everything on the negative side of the human emotional scale feeds these companies millions of dollars per year through the delivery of something every internet business craves: Engagement.<p>OK, great.  What do we do?<p>It&#x27;s hard to imagine how to deal with this due to the many legal and ethical tentacles behind the issue.  We can, however, list two extremes:  Censor everything that does not meet some criteria is one end of that scale.  The other end is not to interfere with communications in any way at all.<p>What&#x27;s a business to do?  What should a business be responsible for?  How does a business get past the inevitable biases of the people who make up the business?<p>Do you force an employee who is against recreational drugs or abortion to not tag posts related to those subjects?<p>Do you force software developers who are for Freedom of Choice to write code that protects the opposite stance?<p>How do you deal with issues in different regions, countries, cultures, religions and political systems?<p>Is a business to be responsible for the consequences of what they, effectively, sell?<p>Yes, social media companies sell speech, emotion, networking, etc.  If they are responsible for the consequences of what they sell, should other companies be charged with similar responsibility?  Should Walmart be liable because they sold a knife to someone who used it during a crime?  Should the company who sold the pressure cooker to the Boston marathon bombers be responsible for what they did with their product?  And, the big one, gun manufacturers and retailers.  Should they be responsible for what&#x27;s done with the products they sell?<p>Things become more interesting and complex as you start to explore the generalization of what started with a simple tweet and the company choosing to insert itself between the source and the audience in some way.<p>To get personal, we have two relatives who are in the grips of these horrible effects social media can produce.  I have watched each of them self-radicalize (it&#x27;s the only term that applies) over the years.  It has been a very slow process.  The start of the effect, thinking back, was truly imperceptible.  As they descended deeper and deeper into their respective the effect accentuated and the pace accelerated.  Years in the making.  Today they are so deeply and solidly entrenched in their camps that it would be impossible for us to pull them back into a reasonable middle.  One of them has absolute and total hatred, virulent hatred, for Trump.  He hates every molecule in Trump&#x27;s body, his family, Republicans, his very existence.  The other hates everything Democrat with equal intensity.  They are polar opposites.  And the worst part:  One is the son of the other.<p>How does this kind of self-radicalization happen?  Now without social media.  At least not to the depth and intensity someone is able to reach today.  And, yes, it is absolutely destroying lives.  In our case, most of the family dreads talking to these two relatives.  Nobody is interested in the conversations they want to have.  What&#x27;s ironic is that this means they go back to their respective social media dens and walk deeper into their respective dark caves.<p>The problem, is the algorithms these companies are using.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t censorship, moderation or the lack thereof.<p>What do I mean?<p>Concerned with what was happening to our relatives, I decided to conduct a simple experiment:<p>I went on Facebook and clicked on the Video tab.  I browsed until I found an anti-Trump video.  I watched it from start to finish.  I then browsed some more and found another one.  Click.  Watch.  Within two or three clicks everything FB was showing me was anti-Trump.  The selection and intensity of the hatred increased as I continued to click-watch these videos.  It was truly horrific to realize how quickly these algorithms allow someone to descend into a dark hole.<p>I then decided to take the stance of someone who, perhaps, noticing he is being fed the same kind of stuff, wants to pull the range of recommendations back to an average setting.  The only way to do it is to find and watch videos on the other end of the scale.  I sat there scrolling through videos for probably 30 minutes before I came across something that was mildly supportive of Trump.  I click-watched.  The effect on the recommendation set was imperceptible.  About 20 minutes of scrolling and I found another.  Click-watch again.  Minor gains.  Now it took about ten minutes.  Click-watch.<p>It took somewhere in the order of two hours of resisting click-watching hateful anti-Trump videos to feel like the recommendation set has some semblance of balance.  It certainly had nothing else.  It was full of Trump-centered videos (love or hate) and nothing else.  No cute puppy videos.  No videos about anything else.  It was a set of videos representing polar opposites.<p>And click-watching any one of them would instantly drop you into a local minima that would lead to radicalizing the selection set within a few clicks.<p>This. This is it.  This is horrible.  And this is what&#x27;s causing much damage.<p>These algorithms are great when you are trying to figure out how to remodel your kitchen or get WebRTC working.  You want &quot;radicalization&quot; because it leads to better and better information.  However, there are subject areas where these algorithms lead to nothing positive.  The outcome is damaging, counterproductive and detrimental to society.<p>I firmly believe this is the step social media companies need to take:  They need to modify the way algorithms treat some subjects in order to always attempt to present a balanced view of the world.  Don&#x27;t allow anyone to descend into the Trump-hatred or Republican-hatred cave just as nobody should be allowed to enter the Biden-hatred or Democrat-hatred tunnels.  Same with other subjects: abortion, drugs, religion, racism, etc.  This isn&#x27;t censorship, this is balance.<p>Don&#x27;t allow easy radicalization when it comes to key subjects.  It should be nearly impossible to be exposed to a constant steam of anti-&lt;pick your topic&gt; videos and posts no matter what someone does.  The same algorithm that helps you learn how to remodel you kitchen is harmful when the subject matter falls into certain categories.<p>And do, by changing the recommendation engines such that they apply reinforcement when warranted (home remodeling, looking for a vacation, coding, learning, woodworking, etc.) and refuse to behave in the same manner with potentially damaging topics (politics, hatred, etc.) the social media companies would be able to deliver a service to society and do right by people not by censoring but simply by not becoming a conduit for self radicalization.<p>Change the algorithm.

23335361,"Before I clicked on the link, I assumed this was yet another egregious lie. But this one really doesn&#x27;t qualify. It falls squarely in the category of reasonable opinions. Let&#x27;s look at the claim: &quot;There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent&quot;. Clearly the veracity of the statement rests on the word &quot;substantially.&quot; It&#x27;s inconceivable that no one ever takes, for example, an elderly relative&#x27;s mail in ballot and votes it fraudulently. So for this to be a reasonable opinion, it merely has to be reasonably possible for the claim to be true.<p>So, let&#x27;s consider if such fraud could possibly be substantial. Let&#x27;s use California as an example. Registering to vote is easy, all you need is a web browser[1] and a mailing address where you reside or with a resident willing to give you ballots or ignorant that they are receiving them[2]. Also, the State of California faces an impractically large legal hurdle to reject suspected fraudulent ballots[3] so it can be assumed that most if not all will be accepted. It seems clear based on the observable facts that substantial fraud is certainly possible under the California regime.

23325731,"I used Gatsby about a year ago for a personal blog, but ended up abandoning it for the following reasons:<p>- Very slow build times. It took me over a minute to build a personal blog.
- Weird forced implementation of GraphQL. To display something as simple as an image I was forced to use GraphQL. Also your GraphQL can&#x27;t be dynamically generated, meaning it&#x27;s hard to make anything modular. And the GraphQL paths has a ton of extraneous nested fields (eg. `data.file.childImageSharp.fixed`)
- Version upgrades were a pain in the ass and would often break my site.
- My site actually seemed slow. For example, links don&#x27;t work until the entire JS loads and executes, so if your internet isn&#x27;t fast then your website basically isn&#x27;t functional for the first 2-5 seconds despite the page being visible.
- Very few themes (maybe be better now, but at the time the selection was awful, especially compared to Jekyll). No real concept of themes in the first place, switching from one theme to another requires an entire code rewrite.
- Limited functionality built-in. For example, want tagging? You&#x27;ll need to code that in.<p>Gatsby sits in an odd spot of not being simple enough to save you a lot of time or empower a non-technical person to manage (eg. like WordPress), but not flexible enough to do anything you want since it&#x27;s an opinionated SSG framework. It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re getting all the complexity of a React&#x2F;GraphQL application, without any of the flexibility of being able to pick your own stack.<p>Sure it has a nice plugin system, but beyond that since you need a developer to set up and maintain a Gatsby site anyways, I don&#x27;t see any reason not to just use Next.js (which can export to static) since all Gatsby really does beyond that is converting markdown to HTML, which is just done through an npm library anyways. If writing a Next.js website is overkill, then why do you need to be devoting engineering resources to this in the first place? Why not just use some no-code solution like WordPress? Or if you really want a separate headless CMS, then Jekyll felt easier and faster to me with more theme options (though again it&#x27;s been a year since I touched these, so I imagine things have improved).<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong I love SSGs as nothing beats the performance, ease of deployment, and low cost of static sites. But if I&#x27;m going to use a SSG framework, it better be dead simple and&#x2F;or easy to customize, otherwise I might as well just use some off-the-shelf &quot;no-code&quot; solution (eg. WordPress, Wix, Squarespace), or use a framework like Next.js that let&#x27;s me customize my stack instead of being locked into Gatsby&#x27;s.

If Fox is your primary source of news, then it does look like Twitter is trying to silence a real issue. If Fox isn&#x27;t your primary source of news then it looks like Twitter is trying to fight misinformation. Things are so crazy that it really is hard to find the truth and there is very good reason to believe that someone is lying. And no one wants to admit that someone they&#x27;ve trusted for a long time is lying to them, especially when there&#x27;s nuggets of truth that you can hold onto.<p>So I&#x27;m a little worried about the repercussions of this, especially since the right already thinks Twitter is supporting the left.<p>Edit: By hard left I mean from the perspective of Fox viewers. My main point is about the perspective of the people this is specifically aimed at. While on the left we don&#x27;t see it that way go talk to your friends on the right, they see it differently.

It&#x27;s functionally sound and standard, but ergonomically painful. I built a really fun horrible hack to allow you to write that instead as this:<p><pre><code>    with do(Maybe) as y:

        b = Maybe(just=x*a)

And there were many, many technical errors — whether it was the girders couldn’t support the weight, or the flooring would sink in, or the doors weren’t big enough to move the gear through.<p>The contract rider read like a version of the Chinese Yellow Pages because there was so much equipment, and so many human beings to make it function. So just as a little test, in the technical aspect of the rider, it would say “Article 148: There will be fifteen amperage voltage sockets at twenty-foot spaces, evenly, providing nineteen amperes …” This kind of thing. And article number 126, in the middle of nowhere, was: “There will be no brown M&amp;M’s in the backstage area, upon pain of forfeiture of the show, with full compensation.”<p>So, when I would walk backstage, if I saw a brown M&amp;M in that bowl … well, line-check the entire production.

But I&#x27;d like to discuss one part of it:<p>&gt; [...] the major websites of today&#x27;s web are not built for the visitor, but as means of using her.<p>To me, here lies a key point that both the writer and many commenters here in HN seemed to miss in 2017. What&#x27;s written here is just a <i>consequence</i>, and the post goes on to develop it through all its length... but why did the dynamics change in that way? What&#x27;s the underlying reason for the shift?<p>Some comments here in HN mentioned it: internet becoming a marketplace. With both its good and bad side-effects. It&#x27;s an extremely complex issue, but money does completely shape dynamics of current society, and therefore internet too, and it leaves us <i>without spaces that aren&#x27;t conditioned by it</i>. At small scale it doesn&#x27;t seem a big problem, or we rationalize it because everyone needs money to survive... But it really shapes the world, and we can&#x27;t simply ignore the ugly sides of it and pretend we can solve it without ever involving the discussion about money and the dynamics it generates.<p>The &quot;magic&quot; the post talks about only needs three ingredients: human curiosity, time (to develop that curiosity), and spaces (to host those humans and their time). Human curiosity and creativity will always exist as long as we don&#x27;t go extinct. About time... well, we can satisfy our basic needs more efficiently than ever... and yet, ironically, we are using the newly freed time to create &quot;more competitive&quot; products that focus on enslaving the potential of our fellow human beings through infinite-scroll addiction, fear of missing out, instant gratification, attention grabbing and other kinds of biases and &quot;bugs&quot; in the human system. And finally spaces. Well, nothing left. If the only accessible spaces require money or work-to-generate-money, you close the circle and can&#x27;t scape the landscape and conditioning I was describing. Even if there are some spaces left, they tend to fell into oblivion against the competition. Too hard to escape, too easy to rationalize.<p>And honestly, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any game-changer discussion about morality standards here. Morals must play a very important part in getting us to start a change (and by us I mean the kind of people that&#x27;s most directly involved in tech, like this HN crowd), but as long as we don&#x27;t try to really disrupt at least some of the dynamics generated by money-profit-survival-motivations, I&#x27;m somewhat skeptical we will be able to move the needle, because efforts will be eaten by the competition even if we never wanted to play under those rules.

But as the conversation here seems to be mostly about the latter…</i>)<p>What a lot of people don&#x27;t realize about LaTeX is that much of its awkwardness comes from it being a product of two very strong personalities (both Turing Award winners for unrelated work!) pulling it in two opposing directions:<p>• Donald Knuth, who designed TeX as a tool for <i>typesetting</i> primarily, allowing a meticulous author complete control over the appearance of his pages, and attempting to capture in a program (or at least making possible) the highest standards of typography developed over the centuries since the invention of printing.(†)<p>• Leslie Lamport, who wrote LaTeX as a macro package running in TeX, trying to hide complexity from the author and making things as convenient as possible, out of a (probably correct) belief that authors should <i>not</i> care about the appearance and instead only focus on the content! (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lamport.azurewebsites.net&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;document-production.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lamport.azurewebsites.net&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;document-production.p...</a>)<p>The result is that with LaTeX, things look “easy” superficially, but everything is implemented in TeX macros (never intended as a full-fledged programming language), so things break in mysterious ways. Not to mention the additional layers of complexity from zillions of users writing their own &quot;packages&quot; for everything. The error messages don&#x27;t make sense to users because they often come from the bowels of TeX, and I suspect that many users even just ignore(!) warnings about overfull&#x2F;underfull boxes.<p>Conversely, if you look at one of Knuth&#x27;s own documents written in plain TeX, everything is startlingly simple: for example there is no automatic equation numbering or cross-references; for Equation 5 you just write &quot;5&quot; in the equation and refer to it as &quot;(5)&quot; later, none of that stuff with &quot;\eqref{eq:foo}&quot; or whatever. If macros are used, they tend to be custom for the document, rather than elaborate general-purpose ones. Consider giving plain TeX a try (a great book is <i>A Beginner&#x27;s Book of TeX</i> by Seroul and Levy); everything makes sense, you feel in power, all the error messages are clear (often the same error messages! but now they apply to something you actually wrote&#x2F;intended), and if nothing else, you&#x27;ll end up with an appreciation of what LaTeX is&#x2F;does.<p>This comment is turning into a repetition of my same tiresome comments on other sites (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cstheory.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;40282"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cstheory.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;40282</a>, <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;398372"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;398372</a>, <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;386592"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;386592</a>, <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;384881"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;384881</a>, <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;518802"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;518802</a> etc.) so I&#x27;ll stop here I guess :-)<p>----<p>(†): good paragraphs, avoiding widows and orphans and hyphenation on consecutive lines and loose&#x2F;tight lines adjacent to each other, all of that.

The main benefit is the extra registers that get unlocked in 64-bit mode while keeping memory usage lower. It seems there’s an attempt to do this in Debian [1]. From what I read it’s not a big win for arm though but could be big for x86 - since the ISA is very different between x86 and x86_64.

23340661,"Here&#x27;s my view: the real world doesn&#x27;t have any free functions.  Say a plate breaks in your kitchen.  What happened? Obviously some kind of an object derived from a circle and and and some sort of factory? And, uh.  Josh you mentioned broken plates.  So, as far as a broken plate, I think we can address this by adding some methods for how many pieces the plate is currently in and which broken piece we&#x27;re talking about then we can specify each broken piece as a simple polygon from the origin of the virtual object, that being the theoretical still-intact plate as manufactured.  We can also specify each plate in terms of the deviations from the platonic ideal plate as specified in the CAD designs.  So let&#x27;s change all the signatures to refer to EITHER 1 whole piece, being the whole plate, or the first broken piece, second broken piece and so on, which can all end up in different places in the world.  Ultimately this will cover just about everything except if someone makes an artisanal plate by gluing together previously broken plates, where they&#x27;re not from the same plate.  That will make garbage collection difficult as the artisanal factory might leak memory if it doesn&#x27;t use every piece.  The solution is to simply do manual garbage collection where we replace each derived plate that is made up of broken plates, with a new plate that is pre-broken, and we just have to set what pieces it is made of, and then the original pieces can be freed.  So actually the base case does need to know whether it is considered &quot;whole&quot; despite being made up of broken pieces, and then it can have virtual pieces that comprise it but know that they have to move and be together as one.  This basically captures the plate abstraction pretty well, as long as you remember that we decided that for the dinner function we decided to set a plate, rather than set a table, so you just do the glass.set() the fork.set() and plate.set() so on, and then you can check that it&#x27;s set, whereas the table they&#x27;re set on might have unrelated items such as a candle, that isn&#x27;t really considered set or not.<p>Javascript: how about we all just use <i>paper plates</i>. do whatever you want with them.<p>Programmer: also works!

Is your privacy policy even valid in the event of an acquisition?

23340302,"I know that there&#x27;s arguments for and against classes and functions.  In recent years, I&#x27;ve come to love functions.  But they are both tools that have cases of appropriateness.<p>However, I think a lot of people are looking at classes the wrong way.<p>In this thread, I&#x27;m hearing that classes should encapsulate functionality.  While this is an aspect of classes, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the main use case of a class.<p>A class should represent a <i>type</i> of state.  That is, if you create an instance of a state, it should only support the attributes and default properties that are defined for it.  This is mainly for shorthand(there&#x27;s usually a syntax to build instances of classes) and for clear documentation.  At a lower level, the availability of a class construct makes it possible for AST parsing to do interesting things to your OO code, although I don&#x27;t know how common that is outside of JavaScript.  If JavaScript didn&#x27;t support class syntax, it&#x27;d probably be more difficult to implement things like decorators, both in terms of the Babel plugins that support it as well as future native syntax support.  But I digress.<p>The way I see it, a class should be responsible for holding a mostly fixed set of attributes, setting defaults for those attributes, and have properties that compute off other properties.<p>What doesn&#x27;t belong in a class are methods that do complex things with other objects and class instances.  If your method does something complicated that affects outside state, it&#x27;s time to extract it to a function that takes a context argument.  This makes it easy to test your function without necessarily having to meet all the requirements of the classes you&#x27;d be using with it, and it makes the code more flexible because you can use it for other contexts besides a single class. <i>(I know that you can use inheritance and composition to kind of do the same thing, but I think this sucks because inheritance introduces problems and composition just adds more code than just importing a function where you actually need to use it.)</i><p>More concisely, a class shouldn&#x27;t be looked at as a module, or a set of related functions that do complex things, especially when not all of those functions rely on a state.  That&#x27;s the job of an actual <i>module</i> construct in the language.  Classes have a specific job, which is to build an instance of a type.  If your class has a lot of functionality that&#x27;s not totally dependent on the class instance itself, it doesn&#x27;t belong there in my opinion.  Just because a class can be used like a module doesn&#x27;t mean that it should.",ravenstine,23333891,False,0.038

(remote&#x2F;outsource&#x2F;offshore)<p>For the last 12 years or so I&#x27;ve worked extensively in all arrangements and here&#x27;s what you need to know.<p>Outsource: Generally this conflates 2 actions. One is paying for a cheaper labor market. The second is paying for less skilled people. Most of the projected cost savings come from the latter. Most of those projected cost savings don&#x27;t appear. I remember folks hiring $10&#x2F;hr DBAs in India and the result was about what you&#x27;d expect. India is full of great DBAs and they ain&#x27;t charging $10&#x2F;hr or at least they haven&#x27;t for a long time. It is the case that you can access a cheaper labor pool. Most people do this and then negate that savings by not creating a remote-first culture and introducing massive language and time zone barriers and friction due to multiple companies interacting.<p>Offshoring: The key difference here is that these are part of your company. In the US it&#x27;s totally possible to set up an office in central&#x2F;south america in-timezone and staff it with amazing people and save some money. Well, except for most of those folks who are willing to relocate will eventually accept offers with FANG companies either locally or relocate. So it&#x27;s a nice scheme while it works. (Hi to all my tico friends now at Google and Amazon)<p>Remote: this is what most people confuse for the above two things. Remote is about doing 2 things.<p>1) Expanding your hiring pool beyond a 30 minute commute from your office (turns out that the other 99.99% of the world&#x27;s population also has some great folks).<p>2) Making your company culture remote-first. But that&#x27;s synonymous with writing things down and documenting things.<p>Sure interpersonal relationships can be trickier to bootstrap and that&#x27;s a real cost. But see #1, nobody talks about that cost.<p>The final thing to keep in mind is that for most big companies, there&#x27;s no way to avoid the remote cost.

23321721,"Professor and curriculum engineer here who has created an undergraduate degree in CS&#x2F;IT. Proof: (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rtc.edu&#x2F;net-arch"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rtc.edu&#x2F;net-arch</a>)<p>First off, this is a great starting point! There is a goal for every year, the courses clearly build upon each other, and there is an end-goal. I am a big advocate for project-based learning, and I&#x27;m seeing more employers seriously consider portfolios like GitHub and blogs. No employer cares that you got a 103% on your algorithms exam, and few vaguely care about your GPA. They do care if you can hold a conversation about a topic. They do care if you applied the knowledge, like building something that uses a tree, even if you didn&#x27;t explicitly write all the data structure code yourself.<p>This curriculum is designed for the elite, think a student that would do well at Stanford. This is probably an obvious comment, as the majority of courses come from Stanford, but it&#x27;s important to note that the breakneck speed of this curriculum targets the top 1-5% percentile of students. If our hypothetical freshman is a high school graduate they need to have done well on the BC Calculus, AP Statistics, and AP Computer Science exams at minimum. It also assumes that the student has enough computer experience to pick up advanced skills rapidly. You could argue that &quot;Introduction to Computer Systems&quot; and &quot;Programming Fundamentals&quot; are entry level, but reading carefully they are closer to the 2nd or 3rd CS course a student would take in a normal sequence. Week 2 in the programming fundamentals talks about Stacks and Queues, and Week 1 in Intro to Computer Systems introduces Unix, the CLI, and GitHub all in one week. These are very advanced topics for students that come in with 0 knowledge. You will need either rigorous admissions requirements, or prepare for a high first-year drop out rate.<p>We tried a 4th year very similar to what was described in the article. Students could pick a final project done in partnership with industry, or report on their internship&#x2F;career if they were already in one. Students responded with &quot;What do I need to do to get full credit?&quot;, &quot;Can you give me step-by-step instructions that I can follow?&quot;, and &quot;What will be on the exam?&quot; (there are no exams in the program after year 2).
After 3 years of being explicitly told what they must do to succeed, students have correctly learned that going above and beyond in a class rarely yields extrinsic benefit within the scope of a class. To put it another way, students are trained to work efficiently in a classroom environment, &quot;Exactly as hard as I need to get the exact grade I want, and not 1% more.&quot;
It&#x27;s not necessarily a bad mindset, but we need to train students out of habits that are bad if applied outside of the classroom. In the case of my program, we chose to set a bar in the 4th year but didn&#x27;t tell students how high to jump. This translates to removing a lot of clarity in assignment rubrics, and providing direction but not answers. A lot of students flailed, but none failed (yet!). Graduates report a smoother transition into industry.
We also introduced GitHub in their third year as a portfolio tool, few students have enough knowledge to understand and use it before then. At the end of every quarter students build a final project in groups, and apply all of the skills that go into a good repository (collaborators, pull requests, readmes, CI, etc.). While not all employers are looking at the actual projects, all students who have graduated thus far have said they used the knowledge of talking about a project in interviews.
On the internship&#x2F;project classes&#x2F;research front, unless you are using your reputation to open those doors for students (as I had to), a student&#x27;s best chance of arbitrary contribution is through GitHub Issues and PRs. Your college&#x27;s reputation is also a major factor here; In the case of my specific college, Amazon Web Services won&#x27;t work with us because of a teaching agreement that went sour before I was hired.<p>Some critiques from others I&#x27;d like to comment on, in lieu of the author:
&quot;Why isn&#x27;t there core class X?&quot; - Most students can&#x27;t handle more than 2 core classes per quarter. That means 24 core classes over a 4 year period. Choose wisely. I think the author chose well, but no plan survives it&#x27;s first encounter. My curriculum certainly didn&#x27;t, and 3 years in we&#x27;ve thrown out almost all of the curriculum we initially wrote.<p>&quot;No ethics, soft skills?&quot; - This is a core class curriculum. Electives and additional classes for &quot;rounding out&quot; a student occur during at a later phase of curriculum design, usually when it&#x27;s time to meet accreditation standards. 
From there you will not like the second part of this answer. In my 3 year study on building an IT bachelor&#x27;s (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nsf.gov&#x2F;awardsearch&#x2F;showAward?AWD_ID=1601140"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nsf.gov&#x2F;awardsearch&#x2F;showAward?AWD_ID=1601140</a>), we found ethics training to work AGAINST a student&#x27;s hiring prospects (cue pitchforks). Our Business and Industry Leadership Team (representatives from technology companies) rated &quot;teaching ethics&quot; at an average of 2.1&#x2F;5 (A 2 means slight disagree that this should be taught). They marked &quot;ethical knowledge application&quot; at 1.4&#x2F;5 (A 1 means strongly disagree that this is important). The BILT team commented that they were unlikely to listen to a recent graduate&#x27;s ethical concerns on a project, they would regard a graduate raising the concerns as a &#x27;nuisance&#x27;, and that they would fire the graduate if their ethical concerns significantly impacted their job performance (cue more pitchforks).
Finally, consider the fresh graduate&#x27;s perspective. The typical first-job-out-of-college mindset is &quot;I have a ton of debt. I&#x27;ll take the first job with the largest salary.&quot; I see this advice regularly on HN.",sonzohan,23321426,False,0.036

HN seems to have a bias against web applications which is probably unfair.<p>Most web developers today do not set out to build web pages. They start with full-on experiences they would like to bring to users, and the web stack is their tool of choice in doing so. There is nothing wrong with this! And different considerations apply in the development of such applications versus a web page.<p>Philosophically, SourceHut is about non-browser-based workflows (e.g. using email for merge requests). Since SourceHut users do far less of their SourceHut-related work on the actual website, SourceHut can afford to take a web page approach. GitHub, in contrast, focuses on browser-based workflows. They actually do a pretty great job at it - and this is something that they can do only because they take a web application approach. I like their keyboard shortcuts, for example, but these would be difficult (impossible?) to implement on a simple HTML page.<p>No single user can say that one approach is right and the other is wrong. All they can do is assert preferences.

The web opened up to the public in 1993.  There was no commerce and marketing in the beginning.  Even by 1996 while commerce and marketing may have existed, e.g., Amazon founded in 1995, its place was in the background.  As I rememember the early web, the foreground, the &quot;starting point&quot; or &quot;portal&quot;, was something like Yahoo!  You had to pick a topic (direction) that you wanted to go in.  For example, if you were after music, you might end up browsing the Internet Underground Music Archive.  The &quot;front page&quot; of the portal was predominantly non-commercial, mostly generic headings for topics.  If you wanted to search out something commercial, no doubt you could but the initial starting point was <i>intellectual curiosity</i>.  This is IMO what has been lost over time with regard to web use: intellectual curiosity and the ability to actually satisfy it.  (A fun tangent here is the collections of inane queries that people type into Google.  These are simultaneously hilarious and disturbing.)<p>As an experiment have a look at the Yahoo! page today.  It is full of low quality mainstream &quot;news&quot;.  There is zero attention to intellectual curiosity.  Nothing to see here, folks, but here is the latest news.  For part 2 of the experiment, run a Google search for the term &quot;music&quot;.  The results are dominated by YouTube.

The chances of someone new to the web not following a link to YouTube or some other Google-controlled domain would seem almost nil.<p>The &quot;onboarding&quot; process for new web users is very different today than it was in the early 1990&#x27;s.

- Software Manager
- Product Manager
- Data analyst or Data Scientist<p>If you assume all of these roles can be collaborated on a async basis and from within different timezones - that makes progress extremely slow right?

You as a company, unless you can spin an entirely new vertical, will back-fill employees from the mid-west again since the remaining team is located in that region.

* It&#x27;s great that you have the [[quick links]] -- but why not work really hard to make the regular inter-linking work?  E.g. if I have [my link](.&#x2F;my-file.md), that should work too, but it doesn&#x27;t.
* Say I find a file, and I want to open it up in the finder.  JetBrains has a right-click action to &quot;Open in enclosing folder&quot; and it pops up the Finder.  Something like that acknowledges that a tool is a part of an ecosystem &amp; provides an &quot;escape hatch&quot; to interact with the files in another way.<p>Overall this is the best attempt I have found.

The bus of such a machine must become virtual and proxyable as well, such that 3rd party software, modular plug-ins, could observe it in realtime, as should memory, emulated VGA card, etc...  any point there&#x27;s a connection to hardware, real or virtual is a proxy point that must be modular and auditable by 3rd party plug-in programs...<p><i>THAT&#x27;s</i> how you write the virtual machines&#x2F;systems of the future.<p>Which also become the debugging systems of the future...<p>In fact, such a &quot;modular virtual machine&quot; -- could be used by AI driven software to run unit tests, but run them with different combinations of VGA cards, emulated CPU&#x27;s, emulated BIOS&#x27;ses, buses, controller chips, what-have-you...<p>Oh... and there should be a way to interface the VM with actual hardware chips... in other words, I have a hardware chip that is in question... emulate the entire rest of the system, but proxy a physical connection to that chip on a breakout board... etc.",peter_d_sherman,23335072,False,0.0
