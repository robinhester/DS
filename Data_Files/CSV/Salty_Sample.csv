Only Facebook gets to decide which Facebook posts to show us.<p>What if, instead, you had a personal AI that read every Facebook post and then decided what to show you.  Trained on your own preferences, under your control, with whatever settings you like.<p>Instead of being tuned to line the pockets of Facebook, the AI is an agent of your own choosing.  Maybe you want it to actually _reduce_ engagement after an hour of mindless browsing.<p>And not just for Facebook, but every website.  Twitter, Instagram, etc.  Even websites like Reddit, which are quot;user moderatedquot;, are still ultimately run by Redditx27;s algorithm and could instead be curated by _your_ agent.<p>I donx27;t know.  Maybe that will just make the echo chambers worse.  But can it possibly make them worse than they already are?  Are we really saying that an agent built by us, for us, will be worse than an agent built by Facebook for Facebook?<p>And isnx27;t that how the internet used to be?  Back when the scale of the internet wasnx27;t so vast, people just ... skimmed everything themselves and decided what to engage with.  So what Ix27;m really driving at is some way to scale that up to what the internet has since become.  Some way to build a tiny AI version of yourself that goes out and crawls the internet in ways that you personally canx27;t, and return to you the things you would have wanted to engage with had it been possible for you to read all 1 trillion internet comments per minute.",fpgaminer,23313007.0,6
23316314.0,"The degree to which “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” is in effect here is remarkable. If Facebook literally removes anything, then HN is outraged because it’s censorship, paternalism, all that. But if Facebook <i>does not adopt an actively paternalistic attitude where it shows people content that they deem is “good for them”</i>, then that’s outrageous too. Both complaints predictably rocket to the top of HN.<p>Which is it, guys? How can you simultaneously be outraged that Facebook is imposing any restrictions on speech at all, and horrified that it <i>isn’t</i> actively molding user behavior on a massive scale?<p>There’s an amusing comment from
a Facebook employee downthread asking: if division is caused by showing people opposing political opinions, should we try to stop that to reduce division, or should we do nothing, to avoid forming filter bubbles?

23314507.0,"I really didnx27;t realize until perhaps the last 2 years that Facebook fundamentally tapped some hidden human needx2F;instinct to argue with people who they believe are incorrect.   Specifically, and more importantly, combined with the human inability to actively decide to <i>not</i> pay attention when things are inconsequential or not yet worth arguing about.<p>Sometimes, just shutting up about an issue and not discussing it is the best thing for a group to do.  <i>Not</i> more advocacy or argument.  Time heals many things.  No app is going to help you take that approach -- and thatx27;s not what technology is going to help solve (or is incentivized to solve).  Just like telling a TV station thatx27;s on 24 hours to <i>not</i> cover a small house fire when therex27;s no other news.<p>People are not good at disengaging from something when thatx27;s the right thing to calm the situation.   And Facebook somehow tapped into that human behavior and (inadvertently or purposefully) fueled so many things that have caused our country (and others) to get derailed from actual progress.<p>There is no vaccine yet for this.<p>And not to dump on the Facebook train, since others would have come to do it instead.

Worse was Facebook’s realization that its algorithms were responsible for their growth.

That means lots of Stephen Colbert and no Fox News.<p>My friend is deeply republican and she will not see any democratic content when she gets suggestions.<p>The problem runs so deep that it is difficult to find new things even if I want.

Itx27;s like entropy in that it only goes in one direction, itx27;s just a matter of time and how much you can push back on it.

Misinformation and propaganda are rampant on their platforms definitely, and echo chambers that reinforce divisive worldviews have probably deepened real societal divisions, but how do you actually implement a policy to stop this? What is quot;propagandaquot;? What is quot;misinformationquot;? The entire core of Facebookx27;s existence is advertising, which means user engagement and reach is the only thing that drives your bottom line; they <i>want</i> to drive users to Facebook and keep them there, and keep them engaged. Theyx27;ve just happened to discover a universal human truth along the way, which is that people <i>like</i> feeling validated, and people <i>like</i> being a member of a tribe. Facebook is the way it is because thats what users <i>want</i>, whether they will admit to it or not.<p>Anything that Facebook does will be perceived as making a political andx2F;or moral statement, which they obviously are trying very hard not to do, because as soon as you take a position you alienate half of the population (at least in the US). Theyx27;ve apparently decided to go the route of burying their heads in the sand instead of <i>trying</i> to make things less tribal and divisive, which in all honesty is a pretty understandable position to take, and yet <i>even while actively trying not to piss off conservatives</i> they have still landed in hot water over perceived favoritism towards the left. They are damned if they do and damned if they donx27;t.<p>So honestly, what is the proposed solution here? What would you do if you were in Zuckerbergx27;s shoes?
