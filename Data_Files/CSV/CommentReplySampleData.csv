23314691,"Thatx27;s beside the point, though. The point here is that Facebook executives were told by their own employees that the algorithms they designed were recommending more and more partisan content and de-prioritizing less partisan content because it wasnx27;t as engaging. They were also told that this was potentially causing social issues. In  response, Kaplanx2F;FB executives said that changing the algorithm would be too paternalistic (ignoring, apparently, that an algorithm that silently filters without user knowledge or consent is already fundamentally quot;paternalisticquot;).

23314767,"No. To me, all recommendation engines should be:<p>- <i>User-configurable and interpretable</i>: Enable tuning or re-ranking of results, ideally based on the ability to reweight model internals in a “fuzzy” way. As an example, see the last comment in my history about using convolutional filters on song spectrograms to distill hundreds of latent auditory features (e.g. Chinese, vocal triads, deep-housey). Imagine being able to directly recombine these features, generating a new set of recommendations dynamically. Almost all recommendation engines fail in this regard—the model feeds the user exactly what the model (designer) wants, no more and no less.<p>- <i>Encourage serendipity</i>: i.e. purposefully select and recommend items that the model “thinks” is outside the user’s wheelhouse (wheelhouse = whatever naturally emerging cluster(s) in the data that the user hangs out in, so pluck out examples from both nearby and distant clusters).

If you didn’t like how the buffalo meat got divvied up, you could propose an alternative, build a coalition around it, and actually make it happen. Success required the agreement of tens of allies — yet those same instincts now drive our actions when success requires the agreement of tens of millions. When we read in the evening paper that we’re footing the bill for another bailout, we react by complaining to our friends, suggesting alternatives, and trying to build coalitions for reform. This primal behavior is as good a guide for how to effectively reform modern political systems as our instinctive taste for sugar and fat is for how to eat nutritiously.<p>Facebook is a collection of your friends or your quot;tribequot;, so repeated arguments with your tribe members is what our unconscious brain pushes us towards.

If a discussion is getting particularly heated, put responses on a time delay.

23318375,"Nah, they’ve already filtered by your IP, geolocation, browser fingerprint, etc.<p>We need access to all the data so we can decide which algorithms to apply. There’s really no escaping that",tambourine_man,23315216,
23318462,"gt; What if, instead, you had a personal AI that read every Facebook post and then decided what to show you. Trained on your own preferences, under your control, with whatever settings you like.<p>There is a feedback problem, though, which is that your preferences are modified by what you see. So the AI problem devolves to showing you the kind of content that makes you want to see more of it, i.e. maximize engagement. I think a lot of people are addicted to controversy, quot;rage porn,quot; anger-inducing content, and these agents are not going to help with this issue.<p>If we could train AI agents to analyze the preferences of people, I think the best use for them wouldnx27;t be to curate your own content, but to use them to see the world from other peoplex27;s perspective. If you know in what quot;opinion clusterquot; someone lies and can predict their emotional reaction to some content, you may be able to identify the articles from cluster A that people from cluster B react the least negatively to, and vice versa. And this could be leveraged to break echo chambers, I think: imagine that article X is rated +10 by cluster A and -10 by cluster B, and article Y is rated +10 by cluster A but only -2 by cluster B. It might be a good idea to promote Y over X, because unlike X, Y represents the views of cluster A in a way that cluster B can understand, whereas X is probably some inflammatory rag.<p>The key is that you canx27;t simply choose content according to a userx27;s current preferences, they also have to be shown adversarial content so that they have all the information they need about what others think. This is how they can retain their agency. Show them stuff they disagree with, but that they can respect.<p>I expect that a system like the one Ix27;m describing would naturally penalize content that paint people with opposing points of view as evil or idiots, because such content is the most likely to be very highly rated by the quot;smartquot; side and profoundly hated by the quot;stupidquot; side. Again, note that Ix27;m not saying content <i>everyone</i> likes should be promoted, itx27;s more like, we should promote the +10x2F;-2 kind of polarization (well thought out opinion pieces that focus on ideas which might be unpopular or uncomfortable) over the +10x2F;-10 kind of polarization (people who disagree with me are evil cretins).",breuleux,23315216,

23318666,"I liked the idea of tweaking the newsfeed based on the frequency of activity of the producers, and bumping down the influence of bots and chain accounts. It would probably make for a higher quality newsfeed, and it wouldnx27;t play favorites. The problem is, as the article suggests, it might decrease the only metrics Facebook cares about, and therex27;s no guarantee it would look fair to the outside world.<p>I am not at all outraged that Facebook would impose quot;restrictionsquot; on speech, nor I think are people in my social circles. You canx27;t have a working newsfeed without a significant amount of filtering, for example. So I suspect thatx27;s a straw man.<p>All that being said, I have left Facebook because I prefer to exercise my freedom _not_ to hear the kinds of speech Facebook has made their stock in trade.

Engaging vociferously is seen almost as a moral imperative; quot;we must fight evil wherever we find itquot; sort of thing.

They arenx27;t accomplishing a single thing by getting so righteously angry over statements the speakers probably arenx27;t even making in good faith.<p>You can even see in the memes. Itx27;s the right that loves quot;trolling libs,quot; and the left thatx27;s taking the bait.
